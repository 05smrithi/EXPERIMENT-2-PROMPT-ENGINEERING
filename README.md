# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.


## Algorithm:
**Topic : Science** 
Basic prmopt (generic)
Q: What is Ohm’s Law?
Refined prompt
Q: Explain Ohm’s Law and its applications.

**Topic : Environmental changes **
Basic prompt(generic)
Q: What is global warming?
Refined prompt 
Q: What is global warming? Discuss its causes, effects, and solutions.

**Topic : General Knowledge**
Basic prompt(generic)
Q: Who is the first woman to go to space?
Refined prompt
Q: Who was the first woman in space, and what was her contribution?

## Output
**Topic : Science** 
Basic prmopt output(generic)
A: Ohm’s Law states that voltage = current × resistance (V = IR).
Refined prompt output
A:
Definition: Ohm’s Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit as V = IR.
Applications:
Designing circuits (calculating resistor values).
Measuring unknown resistance.
Protecting devices from overcurrent.
Limitations: Does not apply to non-linear components like diodes and transistors.

**Topic : Environmental changes **
Basic prompt output(generic)
A: Global warming is the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to greenhouse gases.
Refined prompt output
A:
Definition: Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth’s temperature due to the greenhouse effect.
Causes: Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial emissions.
Effects: Melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather, biodiversity loss.
Solutions: Renewable energy adoption, afforestation, energy efficiency, international climate agreements.

**Topic : General Knowledge**
Basic prompt output(generic)
A: Valentina Tereshkova from the Soviet Union in 1963.
Refined prompt output
A:
Name: Valentina Tereshkova.
Country: Soviet Union (USSR).
Year & Mission: 1963, Vostok 6 mission.
Significance: First and youngest woman in space, spent ~3 days orbiting Earth. Pioneered women’s participation in space exploration.


## Result
